# Away Lights

### Away Lights Parent App
This SmartApp provides a central access point for the user to configure multiple lights to simulate presence while away by using the 'Away Light' child app.

### Away Light Child App
The 'Away Light' SmartApp turns a light on/off simulate presence while away. It can be configured to run only when it's dark out, between certain times, or on particular days of the week. The light can be scheduled to turn on/off at preset intervals within the automation window, and the user can specify a random factor so that the light doesn't turn on/off at exactly the same time every day, making its operation seem more 'human'.

## About the Author
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astrowings/SmartThings/master/images/clown.JPG" width="80" height="80" align="left">

Currently living in Alberta, Canada, I've been serving in the Canadian Air Force since 1998 and I am by no means an advanced programmer. I do however like to learn and come up with my own solutions to problems. I have absolutely no formal training/education in software development, but I like to learn new things and find ways to put that to good use. I use Excel quite a lot, both for work and personal data organization, I have some experience with MS Access, and a basic knowledge at writing VBA code to suit my needs.<br><br>
I acquired a SmartThings hub in late summer of 2016 and have taken an interest in learning to write my own applications. I still have a lot of learning to do and my code isn't perfect, it works for me and I can usually find a way to get it to do what I want. That being said, I'm open to comments and suggestions on how to improve my coding method, and will also consider requests if you need one of my apps tweaked for your particular use.<br><br>
Thanks for stopping by to read about me.<br>

#### [SmartThings IDE GitHub Integration Instructions](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/github-integration.html)
* This document explains how to link GitHub to your SmartThings IDE. This allows you to be able to see when this SmartApp gets updated and enables you to apply the updates much more easily. _"The GitHub IDE integration allows you to integrate your forked SmartThingsPublic repository with the IDE. This allows you to easily view and work with SmartApps or Device Handlers already in the repository, as well as update the versions in your IDE with upstream repository changes, and make commits to your forked repository right from the IDE."_

## About the Author
Currently living in Alberta, Canada, I've been serving in the Canadian Air Force since 1998 and I am by no means an advanced programmer. I do however like to learn and come up with my own solutions to problems. I have absolutely no formal training/education in software development, but I like to learn new things and find ways to put them to good use. I use Excel quite a lot, both for work and personal data organization, I have some experience with MS Access, and a basic knowledge at writing VBA code to suit my needs.<br><br>

I acquired a SmartThings hub in late summer of 2016 and have taken an interest in learning to write my own applications. I still have a lot of learning to do and my code isn't perfect, but it works for me and I can usually find a way to get it to do what I want. That being said, I'm open to comments and suggestions on how to improve my coding method, and will also consider requests if you need one of my apps tweaked for your particular use.<br><br>

## Links and How-To's
#### [GitHub Project Issues Link](https://github.com/astrowings/SmartThings/issues)
* Use this link to report a bug or submit a suggestion for improving this SmartApp. Since all my SmartApps are part of the same GitHub 'Project', __be sure to specify which SmartApp your issue relates to__.

#### [SmartThings IDE GitHub Integration Instructions](http://docs.smartthings.com/en/latest/tools-and-ide/github-integration.html)
* This document explains how to link GitHub to your SmartThings IDE. This allows you to be able to see when this SmartApp gets updated and enables you to apply the updates much more easily. _"The GitHub IDE integration allows you to integrate your forked SmartThingsPublic repository with the IDE. This allows you to easily view and work with SmartApps or Device Handlers already in the repository, as well as update the versions in your IDE with upstream repository changes, and make commits to your forked repository right from the IDE."_
